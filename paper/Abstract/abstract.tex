As quantitative American options pricing is a field of both heavy research and analysis, numerous pricing models have been and continue to be developed and refined. The intent of this research paper is to quantitatively compare some of the many options-pricing methods based off the classic Black-Scholes-Merton and the Binomial options pricing models. Results and accuracy vis-a-vis real world options pricing data are discussed, as well as trends realized as part of the analysis.
